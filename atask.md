## Documentation Requirements

For each implemented animation:

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Add JSDoc comments explaining the animation purpose
   - Document any props and customization options
   - Include performance considerations

2. **Animation Parameters**:
   - Document specific timing values used
   - Note any easing functions and why they were selected
   - Record spring configurations for physics-based animations

3. **Accessibility Notes**:
   - Document how reduced motion is supported
   - Note any adjustments made for accessibility concerns

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Record any performance testing results
   - Document optimizations applied to specific animations
   - Note any browser-specific considerations

## Progress Tracking

Use the checkboxes to track progress. Mark tasks as completed when:
- The animation is fully implemented
- It has been tested across different devices
- Documentation has been added
- Performance has been verified

Start with the foundation tasks and progress through the sections in order of visibility and importance.
