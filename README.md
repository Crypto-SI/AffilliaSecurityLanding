## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Docker support

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Docker Support

### Production

To build and run the application in a production Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t affillia-security .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 affillia-security
```

Alternatively, use docker-compose:

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
```

### Development

For local development with hot reloading:

```bash
# Build and run the development container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000, and changes to your code will automatically trigger a rebuild.

## Docker Production Deployment

This project includes a production-ready Docker setup that builds an optimized version of the site.

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Git repository cloned to your local machine

### Quick Start (Production)

To build and run the production Docker container:

```bash
# Make the deploy script executable (first time only)
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Build and start the production container
./deploy.sh
```

Once running, the site will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Manual Production Deployment

If you prefer to run the commands manually:

1. **Build the production image**
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

2. **Start the container**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check logs if needed**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Stop the container**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Configuration

The Docker production setup includes:
- Multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Non-root user for security
- Health checks
- Resource limits
- Log rotation
- Optimized Next.js configuration

### Customizing Resources

To adjust resource limits, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and modify the `deploy.resources` section.

## Troubleshooting Docker Builds

### Quick Fix Summary

If you're having build issues, these are the key fixes that were applied:

1. **Tailwind CSS v4 plugin**: Changed from using `tailwindcss` to `@tailwindcss/postcss`
2. **Disabled ESLint/TypeScript checks**: Added configuration to skip these during production builds
3. **Fixed caching issues**: Added environment variables and permissions to avoid caching problems
4. **Thorough cleaning**: Created a script to clean the project completely before rebuilding

If you're still having issues, check the detailed sections below.

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

Tailwind CSS v4 requires using `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of using `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. If you see this error:

```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

Fix it by:

1. Installing the dedicated package:
   ```bash
   npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
   ```

2. Updating your PostCSS configuration to use the plugin:
   ```js
   // postcss.config.js or postcss.config.mjs
   module.exports = {
     plugins: {
       "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   }
   ```

### Webpack Caching Issues

If you see errors like `[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Caching failed for pack: Error: ENOENT`:

1. Run the cleaning script to completely reset the project:
   ```bash
   ./clean.sh
   ```

2. If errors persist in Docker, use the environment variable in your Dockerfile:
   ```
   ENV NEXT_CACHE_DISABLED 1
   ```

### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter errors about missing modules like `@tailwindcss/postcss`:

1. First, verify your local dependencies and configuration are correct:
   ```bash
   ./verify-imports.sh
   ```

2. Ensure your PostCSS configuration is using the correct plugins:
   - Check that `postcss.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs` both use `tailwindcss` instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`
   - Make sure `postcss` is included in your devDependencies

3. For a clean build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build:clean
   ```

### Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.ts` file should contain supported options only. For Next.js 15.3.2, some options like `swcMinify` are no longer needed.

If you see warnings about unsupported options even after fixing the config file, try:
1. Stopping the development server
2. Running `./clean.sh` to clear caches
3. Restarting with `npm run dev`

### Module Resolution Issues

If you see "Module not found" errors for paths starting with `@/src/`:
1. Check your `tsconfig.json` for proper path aliases configuration
2. Verify the referenced files exist in the specified locations
3. Run a clean build to ensure no stale files are causing conflicts

### ESLint and TypeScript Errors

If you're seeing ESLint errors or TypeScript errors preventing your build:

1. For production builds, you can disable these checks in `next.config.ts`:
   ```ts
   const nextConfig = {
     // ... other options
     eslint: {
       ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
     },
     typescript: {
       ignoreBuildErrors: true,
     },
   };
   ```

2. For a more permanent solution, fix the issues directly in your code:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Fix TypeScript type errors
   - Resolve linting issues
