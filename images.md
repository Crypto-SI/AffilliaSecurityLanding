# Design Brief: Premium Services Card Images

## Unified Design Prompt

Create a set of 7 abstract geometric images for our premium security services cards that follow these guidelines:

### Brand Style
- **Art Style**: "Sophisticated Geometric Security Aesthetics" featuring clean lines, sharp angles, and well-defined geometric shapes (hexagons, triangles, interlocking forms)
- **Visual Approach**: Abstract rather than literal, using geometric forms to suggest protection, security, and analysis
- **Execution**: Minimalist, uncluttered compositions with layered elements creating subtle depth
- **Mood**: Professional, sophisticated, trustworthy, and discreet (never aggressive or threatening)

### Color Palette
- Primary background: Deep Navy Blue (#1A202C)
- Accent elements: Metallic Gold (#B08D57)
- Highlights: Off-White/Light Cream (#E8E6E1)
- Use subtle gradients and varying opacities of these colors to create depth

### Required Images (7 total)

1. **Personal Protection**: Geometric shapes forming a protective perimeter around a subtle human silhouette, suggesting discreet protection that blends with surroundings

2. **Residential Security**: Abstract architectural elements with layered hexagonal patterns forming a protective boundary around a subtle home silhouette

3. **Risk Assessment**: Interconnected geometric patterns suggesting analytical scanning/assessment processes with subtle pattern transitions

4. **Executive Protection**: Layered geometric shapes creating a shield/barrier around a silhouette, suggesting multi-level security with architectural elements for strength

5. **Secure Transportation**: Abstract representation of secure transit using flowing geometric shapes suggesting movement, with subtle vehicle elements integrated into protective forms

6. **Residential Security Assessment**: Geometric patterns forming a secure perimeter with architectural elements and shield-like patterns inspired by our logo

7. **Threat Intelligence**: Network of interconnected nodes forming an information grid, with layered elements suggesting monitoring and analysis

### Technical Specifications
- Resolution: 800 x 600 pixels minimum (16:9 ratio preferred)
- Format: PNG with transparency or JPG with navy background
- File Size: Optimize for web, under 300KB per image
- Design for text overlay compatibility
- Ensure all images feel part of the same visual family

### Important Notes
- Avoid literal security imagery (no cameras, guards, weapons, screens, or technical diagrams)
- All images should reinforce our brand values: Trust, Discretion, Professionalism, and Security
- Focus on abstract geometric representation rather than realistic depiction
- Images should appear sophisticated and premium, aligned with high-net-worth clientele
