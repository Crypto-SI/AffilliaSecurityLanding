    *   `affseclogolight.png`: Black symbol and text on an off-white/light background. To be used on light backgrounds.

*   **Usage:**
    *   The appropriate logo version should be chosen to ensure maximum contrast and legibility against its background.

## 4. Art Style

*   **Style Name:** Sophisticated Geometric Security Aesthetics

*   **Description & Principles:**
    This art style, strongly reflected in the Affillia Security logo, is chosen to communicate precision, modern protection strategies, intelligence, and a high level of sophistication. It is not overtly aggressive but rather conveys robust security through visual refinement and structure.

    *   **Geometric Precision & Symbolism (as seen in the logo):**
        *   The logo's central monogram, an interlocking geometric "S" within a shield-like hexagon, is the primary example of this principle.
        *   Utilize clean lines, sharp angles, and well-defined geometric shapes (e.g., hexagons, triangles, interlocking forms, or abstract constructions inspired by the logo's structure) in supporting graphics and UI elements.
        *   These elements subtly suggest shields, networks, layers of protection, strength, and focused attention, echoing the logo's design language.
        *   Patterns derived from geometric tessellations or grids can be used for backgrounds or decorative elements, conveying order and thoroughness.

    *   **Abstract & Conceptual Imagery:**
        *   Favor abstract representations over literal depictions of security personnel or equipment where possible, especially for background or thematic visuals.
        *   Think in terms of light patterns, subtle network lines, sophisticated data visualizations (stylized, not complex charts), or architectural close-ups that feel secure and modern.
        *   The abstraction should evoke feelings of safety, advanced methodology, and discreet oversight.

    *   **Layering and Depth:**
        *   Subtle use of layering in graphics can imply comprehensive protection and multi-faceted security solutions.
        *   This can be achieved with overlapping geometric shapes, variations in opacity, or subtle gradients that create a sense of depth and complexity handled with ease.

    *   **Minimalist Execution:**
        *   While incorporating geometric elements, maintain an overall clean and uncluttered aesthetic.
        *   Focus on high-impact visuals with ample negative space to ensure a premium feel and clear communication.
        *   Avoid overly ornate or busy compositions.

    *   **Integration with Photography:** When photography is used (see Section 7), geometric overlays or framing elements from this art style can be subtly integrated to maintain brand consistency.

## 6. Typography

Based on the typography observed in the logo:

*   **Primary Typeface ("AFFILLIA"): Classic Elegance Serif**
    *   **Characteristics:** The font used for "AFFILLIA" is a traditional serif with a strong, elegant, and authoritative character. It features distinct contrast between thick and thin strokes.
    *   **Suggested Application:** Ideal for main website headings (H1, H2), the brand name itself, and other prominent textual elements where impact and sophistication are desired.
    *   **Possible Similar Fonts (if the exact one isn't available or for web use):**
        *   Cormorant Garamond
        *   Playfair Display
        *   Libre Baskerville
        *   A high-quality Garamond or Times New Roman variant (ensure it matches the premium feel).

*   **Secondary Typeface ("SECURITY"): Clean Modern Sans-Serif**
    *   **Characteristics:** The font used for "SECURITY" is a clean, geometric, all-caps sans-serif. It is highly legible and provides a modern, stable contrast to the primary serif.
    *   **Suggested Application:** Suitable for sub-headings (H3, H4), body text, captions, navigation links, and calls to action. Its clarity is excellent for readability in smaller sizes and for functional text.
    *   **Possible Similar Fonts (if the exact one isn't available or for web use):**
        *   Montserrat
        *   Open Sans
        *   Lato
        *   Roboto
        *   Inter (Often used with shadcn/ui)

*   **Hierarchy & Usage:**
    *   Maintain a clear typographic hierarchy. The "AFFILLIA" serif should be used for higher-level headings to convey brand authority.
    *   The "SECURITY" sans-serif should be used for body copy and functional text to ensure readability and a modern feel.
    *   Consistent font sizing, weights, and line spacing will be crucial for a polished and professional website appearance. These will be further defined when setting up the Next.js project and shadcn/ui theme.

## 7. Imagery & Photography Style

*   **Overall Feel:** Professional, discreet, reassuring, and high-quality.
*   **Depicting Personnel (If necessary and rare):**
    *   Focus on professionalism, alertness, and readiness, but *avoid showing identifiable faces of operatives* to maintain discretion and security.
    *   Shots can be from behind, show silhouettes, focus on details (e.g., a hand, a part of a uniform if applicable and generic), or be artfully blurred if a human presence is needed.
    *   The goal is to imply competence without compromising operative anonymity.
*   **Environments:** Clean, modern, secure, and well-maintained spaces. Can include high-end residential, corporate, or travel settings (e.g., private jet interiors, secure entryways).
*   **Conceptual/Abstract Photography:** Aligned with the "Sophisticated Geometric Security Aesthetics." This could include:
    *   Architectural details with strong lines and geometric shapes.
    *   Abstract light patterns or motion blurs suggesting movement and vigilance.
    *   High-tech textures or close-ups of sophisticated (but generic) equipment if relevant.
*   **Avoid:**
    *   Aggressive or threatening imagery (no overt display of weapons or confrontational stances).
    *   Stock photos that look generic, cheap, or overly staged.
    *   Dark, grainy, or low-quality images.
    *   Clich√©d security imagery (e.g., generic hackers in hoodies, overly dramatic scenarios).

## 8. Tone of Voice

*   **Confident & Authoritative:** Assured in expertise and ability to protect.
*   **Reassuring & Calm:** Instilling peace of mind in clients.
*   **Professional & Respectful:** Courteous and formal, yet approachable.
*   **Discreet & Understated:** Avoiding boastful or overly sensational language. Facts and capabilities over hype.
*   **Clear & Concise:** Direct and easy to understand, avoiding jargon where possible or explaining it if necessary.
*   **Client-Focused:** Emphasizing benefits and solutions tailored to the client's unique needs and concerns.

## 9. Guiding Principle

Every element of the Affillia Security brand should convey **Trusted, Discreet, Professional Protection.**
